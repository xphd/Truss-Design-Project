Hi class,

Attached is the matlab code and data from today's lecture. Also attached is the latest grading rubric that
Lauren will be using to grade your lab reports. Compared to the original lab handout, these are three main
changes:

1) Use Matlab instead of hand-drawn plots

2) For all the data fitting and error estimation steps, fit a line to Load vs (1/L^2) instead of Load vs. L.
Except for this change, all of the other instructions given in the report for calculating the best fit,
standard deviations, etc., remain the same.

3) Plot the data (Load vs. L) and best model fit for the Euler equation, and plot bounding curves. Refer to
this figure in the discussion on dominant sources of error, considering both uncertainty in the test
method and uncertainty in the various parameters in the model (Young's modulus, moment of inertia,
reaction conditions.) Feel free to add more figures or bounding curves to strengthen your discussion.

The lab due date has been extended to March 5 in class.

p.s. I also made a folder for section C1 under course documents on blackboard, and posted the lecture
notes on beam buckling
